Notes:

When you run the server.py file, then run the client.py file on multiple devices connected to the LAN. 
After that, all clients will connect to the server and receive a welcome message. 
If any client sends a message,  broadcasts the message to all connected clients, except the sender. 
The message is received by all clients along with the sender's IP address and the message they sent.
